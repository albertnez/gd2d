Graph drawing using attraction and repulsive forces between nodes.
All nodes are repelled by other nodes. And nodes conected with edges are attracted.
With your mouse, you can drag and moves nodes (left click), create new nodes (right click), or join nodes with edges (hold right button, and move from one node to another).
